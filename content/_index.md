Welcome to my website. My name is Ásgeir (IPA: [auːskeir̥]) and I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [University of Iceland](https://www.hi.is/). 

I have a PhD in Philosophy from the [University of St Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and the [University of Stirling](http://www.stir.ac.uk/) [(SASP)](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~sasp/) and was formerly a [Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher](http://www.ub.edu/diaphora/) at Stirling.

I also have an M.Sc in Logic from the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.illc.uva.nl).
			
My current [research interests](/research/) are in the philosophy of mathematics.
