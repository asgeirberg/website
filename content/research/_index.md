### Current research interests

My dissertation was on Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics, in particular, on the rule- following paradox. As a part of this work, I developed a game-theoretic solution to the paradox which identifies the correct application of a term with a correlated equilibrium of what I called *basic constitutive practices*. The main advantages of this solution are that the game-theoretic apparatus allows us to avoid circularity in the explanation of what it is to follow a rule and that certain influential arguments against community solutions to the problem are dissolved, thereby preserving objectivity in our practice. A paper outlining the solution was recently published in *Inquiry* (see above).

My current research interests are in the further development of the game-theoretic account of rules and its application to the philosophy of mathematics, as I believe it can be used to answer some well-known objections to conventionalism about mathematical truth, as well as provide a novel solution to the application problem, i.e. of explaining why mathematics is useful in science. 

I am also interested in exploring the application of the solution to other fields of philosophy, e.g. ethics and theories of intentionality.
